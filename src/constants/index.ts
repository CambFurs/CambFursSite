Drugs have been particularly highlighted as discussions of the use of either illegal drugs, or the misuse of drugs, have a tendency to spiral out of control." },

This includes vore and gore.", reason: "Discussion of “heavy” or “extreme” kinks can easily make those not interested in them uncomfortable.

    { key: 7, rule: "No politics in group chat.", reason: "Whilst politics is an important subject it's one where people often have strong opinions and tend to devolve very quickly into toxic and unpleasant chat. To avoid this we're not allowing discussion of politics. Encouragement of people to vote is fine, but not with discussion around specific parties or policies." },

If you feel an admin is being unfair, contact another admin."},
